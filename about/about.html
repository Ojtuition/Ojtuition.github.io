          <h1>How we started</h1>
          <p>Founded by Olivia Johnson in 2007, OJ Tuition started as a simple home tuition service fuelled by a passion for educational excellence. Olivia, an expert in multi-sensory learning and a qualified SENCO, found that students responded to more than just traditional learning styles. <br><br>Over the next few years, she developed her approach to learning that would lead many of her students to academic success and further education - many achieving grades beyond their expectations. <br><br> Today that home tutor service has evolved into an entire method of teaching, and continues to lead children of all ages to reach their full potential.</p>
          <h1>Why home tuition?</h1>
          <p>The first big benefit of tuition, as with most things in life, is <span class="highlight">preparation</span>. Everyone, children and adults alike, have strengths and weaknesses. Your child could go to an excellent school, be an impeccable student who excels in all subjects and still finds that he/she struggles in certain areas. It could be a specific subject, a challenge with aspects of his/her education (such as how he/she responds to teaching methods) or even the pressure to succeed. Home tuition allows the child to address the problems at hand and deal with them in a safe and supportive environment, laying the foundation for academic success. <br><br>The second is <span class="highlight">focus</span>. Focus isn’t the easiest thing to achieve in a classroom full of 30 children. A student can easily be distracted by his peers, and teachers, unfortunately, can sometimes find it difficult to give everyone the time they need. The added focus <span class="highlight">one-one</span> lessons provide are substantial, and OJ Tuition’s <span class="highlight">group lessons</span> never contain more than 10 students at a time. <br><br>The third is <span class="highlight">feedback</span>. Our tutors keep records on your child’s development on a lesson by lesson basis. Unlike parent’s evenings, feedback is given at the end of every <span class="highlight">one-one</span> lesson, or at regular intervals for <span class="highlight">group lessons</span>. If you ever need to discuss how your child is doing, our tutors are always available to talk.</p>

					<h1>Kind words from our clients</h1>
					<div class="a_c_test shad">
						<p>"My 9 year old son, Daniel, has been tutored by Olivia for Maths and English for about 5 months now and he is thoroughly enjoying her sessions.  Olivia is extremely patient and explains things properly and repeatedly until he understands.  She is a lovely tutor who puts Daniel at ease and this is making a tremendous difference to his confidence.  She makes lessons fun, even introducing word puzzles for him to solve which is a great way to learn.  I would recommend Olivia to anyone!"</p>
