				<p>Whether you require KS1 or A-Level tuition, our approach to tuition is the same throughout. All our lessons follow the national curriculum and we work with approved educational material to help deliver them. Once we have established which learning style suits the student best, we aim to quickly ascertain strengths and weaknesses and work with students to develop a scheme of work that seeks to challenge them, while complimenting their mainstream education<br><br>Mounting pressure on students to perform is a real concern of ours, and students are encouraged to discuss their anxieties surrounding their education. We believe first and foremost that support, not pressure, is key to success in academia. Learning shouldn’t be a struggle!</p>

					<h1 class="lead">What are learning styles?</h1>
					<p>A persons learning style, simply put, is an individual’s preferred way of absorbing, processing and retaining new information <br><br>A school of thought among the educational field since the mid 1970’s, practitioners of the multisensory method adapt their lessons  to maximize the student’s attention and retention of educational material. When taking advantage of the learning style most appealing to a student, a marked increase in performance and focus can be seen. There are seven identified learning styles:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="l_ul1">Visual</span> <br> <span class="l_ul2">(spatial)</span>: A preference for using pictures, images, and spatial understanding</li>
						<li><span class="l_ul1">Aural</span> <br> <span class="l_ul2">(auditory-musical)</span>: The utilisation of sound and music</li>
						<li><span class="l_ul1">Verbal</span> <br> <span class="l_ul2">(linguistic)</span>: A preference words, both in speech and writing</li>
						<li><span class="l_ul1">Physical</span> <br> <span class="l_ul2">(kinesthetic)</span>:  The use of touch</li>
						<li><span class="l_ul1">Logical</span> <br> <span class="l_ul2">(mathematical)</span>: The logic, reasoning and systems</li>
						<li><span class="l_ul1">Social</span> <br> <span class="l_ul2">(interpersonal)</span>: Learning through discussion</li>
						<li><span class="l_ul1">Solitary</span> <br> <span class="l_ul2">(intrapersonal)</span>: A preference for working alone</li>
					</ul>
					<p>People can have one or several preferred learning styles and it often changes as we grow and develop throughout our lives. Learning to recognise how best to absorb new information can prepare us at all stages of learning, after all, learning should first and foremost be an appealing endeavour! <br><br> As part of our initial assessment, OJ Tutors aim to understand your child’s learning style and tailor their lessons to accommodate it</p>
